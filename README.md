# Disaster Response Pipeline Project

### Project Overveiw:
In this project, we are using data set containing real messages that were sent during disaster events. We create a machine learning pipeline to categorize these events so that we can send the messages to an appropriate disaster relief agency.

The project includes a web app where an emergency worker can input a new message and get classification results in several categories. The web app also has three visualizations of the data.

Below are a few screenshots of the web app:

### Instructions:
1. Run the following commands in the project's root directory to set up your database and model.

    - To run ETL pipeline that cleans data and stores in database
        `python data/process_data.py data/disaster_messages.csv data/disaster_categories.csv data/DisasterResponse.db`
    - To run ML pipeline that trains classifier and saves
        `python models/train_classifier.py data/DisasterResponse.db models/classifier.pkl`

2. Go to `app` directory: `cd app`

3. Run your web app: `python run.py`

4. Click the `PREVIEW` button to open the homepage

#### Project Component:
**1. ETL Pipeline**<br>
The Python script, `process_data.py`, implements data cleaning pipeline that:

- Loads the messages and categories datasets
- Merges the two datasets
- Cleans the data
- Stores it in a SQLite database

**2. ML Pipeline**<br>
The Python script, `train_classifier.py`, includes machine learning pipeline that:

- Loads data from the SQLite database
- Splits the dataset into training and test sets
- Builds a text processing and machine learning pipeline
- Trains and tunes a model using GridSearchCV
- Outputs results on the test set
- Exports the final model as a pickle file

**3. Flask Web App**<br>
A flask web app that:

- Displays three data visualization using Plotly
- Recieves text message and show the result for each category
